# Employee-Tracker-Database
A complete backend project using node.js and MySQL (no deployed site). This backend application uses user input from inquirer to populate an employee database. When the user adds an employee they will be asked which deparment that employee will be working in, salary, and who their supervisor is. If you add a new department the information will be stored in the department selection.
